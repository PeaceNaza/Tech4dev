    <h2>Server side rendering vs client side rendering</h2>
    <small>Author: Leom Ching</small>
    <p>
    Learn when you should choose CSR or SSR based on how it will impact your SERP position and your website’s user experience.
    Faster webpage loading times play a big part in user experience and SEO, with page load speed a key determining factor for Google’s algorithm.

    A front-end web developer must decide the best way to render a website so it delivers a fast experience and dynamic content.
    
    Two popular rendering methods include client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR).
    
    All websites have different requirements, so understanding the difference between client-side and server-side rendering can help you render your website to match your business goals.

    <h2>What Is Client-Side Rendering, And How Does It Work?</h2>
    <small>Author: Leom Ching</small>
    <p>
      Client-side rendering is a relatively new approach to rendering websites.

      It became popular when JavaScript libraries started integrating it, with Angular and React.js being some of the best examples of libraries used in this type of rendering.
      
      It works by rendering a website’s JavaScript in your browser rather than on the server.
      
      The server responds with a bare-bones HTML document containing the JS files instead of getting all the content from the HTML document.
      
      While the initial upload time is a bit slow, the subsequent page loads will be rapid as they aren’t reliant on a different HTML page per route.

    <h2>What Are The Differences Between Client-Side And Server-Side Rendering?</h2>
    <small>Author: Leom Ching</small>
    <p>
      The main difference between these two rendering approaches is in the algorithms of their operation. CSR shows an empty page before loading, while SSR displays a fully-rendered HTML page on the first load.

      This gives server-side rendering a speed advantage over client-side rendering, as the browser doesn’t need to process large JavaScript files. Content is often visible within a couple of milliseconds.
